Project: number-display
Authors: Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.

Questions: 

5. The terminal window displays: "NumberDisplay hours = new NumberDisplay(24);"
   and once I increment the hours it shows me: "hours.increment();" the amount of times I clicked it 
6. Each time I increment and reach value 60 on minutes display i should increment only once the hours display
7. The code I had written working successfully
8.When you setValue to 3 it changes to 3 but if set val.ue is et to 10 it stays the same
9.I predicted that it would show error since the value was already set from the beginning
  and I was right.
10.I see: (Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context)
11.We don't need to explicitly use int for this line. So we remove the 'int'
12.I had predicted that if i had put a negative number into the setValue it would have printed
   the previous setValue
13.The Value wouldn't accept 0 as a greater value
14.I couldn't find the line as replaces but after coping the sigh it does not allow me to compile the code
15.The first and last one come as 'true'
16.(a &&b)
17.???
18.
